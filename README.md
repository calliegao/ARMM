# ARMM
The axis-referenced morphometric model of hippocampus.

This repository storges code and results for the paper "An axis-referenced morphometric model reshaping the hippocampus following its longitudinal organization". 
The axis-referenced morphometric model (ARMM) represent the hippocampal surface and medial surface by laminar architecture. This model has been verified to precisely measure morphometric features and shape variations due to the neurodegeneration. The three advantages of the model:
1)	By characterizing laminae (the functional units of hippocampus) along entire long axis, ARMM provides finer structural subdivisions than subfields. 
2)	ARMM allows to stably align hippocampi across individuals with variable morphologies by a uniform planar orthogonal coordinate system. 
3)	The method offers a way to generate anatomical motivated structural features that characterizes aging and diseases associated damage of hippocampus.

An automatic pipeline to generate population hippocampi on 3T MRI will be ready after the paper being accepted.
